  content: "\
in time they say, the pain will fade and sadness drifts away\n\
yet every time I feel regret, I think what mom would say\n\
\n\
when I was young, I dropped a dish, it shattered on the floor\n\
she asked me why I cried and said we can't go back before\n\
\n\
what's done is done, we must move on, so pick the pieces up\n\
and if that was our very best, then hold your head high up\n\
\n\
so practical, her methods and the way she chose her path\n\
it's logical, in looking back, I see why she chose math\n\
\n\
she knew that people's number struggles cause an endless strife\n\
and overcoming mental blocks unlocks careers in life\n\
\n\
there was no soul she could not touch within her classroom realm\n\
for though the depths are quite complex, my mother manned the helm\n\
\n\
she taught through all the ups and downs, to any age or creed\n\
with chalk and jokes and anecdotes, a guiding force indeed\n\
\n\
a language shared across the world, that vast topology\n\
she spanned it like a flag unfurled through new technology\n\
\n\
her life was not an easy one, with obstacles abound\n\
to teach in a non-native tongue, a distant, foreign sound\n\
\n\
but though my mom can't be with us, her vision stays yet true\n\
may those who still remember her, embrace her passion too\n\
\n\
\"empowerment\", it was her goal for what more can we give\n\
but chances for the ones we love, the chance for dreams to live\n\
\n",
